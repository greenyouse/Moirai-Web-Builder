# Moirai Web Builder 
---------------------
This is a website generator to be used with XBMC for building small
video sites. It was a project I did mostly to learn AppleScript. 

If you're looking for a real tool for watching your XBMC files over the
internet, I'm sure there are more serious projects that do better jobs
than this one.

The original google code site for this project still exists here:
